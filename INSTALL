INSTALLATION

=== General ===

To be able to install this package on your UNIX system, you will need
super-user (root) privilegs.  That's required, because TkDialup needs
to read from a protected logfile (/var/log/ppp.log or similar).  There
is a small setuid-script "status-reader.pl" which does the actual log
file scanning.

Please note that Perl-5, Perl/Tk and X11 have to be installed on your
system, or TkDialup will not work.

You may need to edit "status-reader.pl" if pppd does not send its log
messages to neither /var/log/ppp.log nor /var/log/syslog.  After
your editing is done, you may have to restore file permissions:
  # chmod 04755 status_reader.pl
You have to be root to do this.


=== Debian GNU/Linux ===

  $ su -c "apt-get install perl-tk"  # if perl/tk not already installed
  $ su -c "make dist.deb && dpkg -i dist.deb"


=== Other GNU/Linux Systeme [untested] ===

  $ su -c "make install"


=== *BSD Systems using pppd for outgoing PPP [untested] ===

  $ su -c "make install"


=== *BSD using User-PPP/tunnel-device [currently not working] ===

  If you prefer to use so called User-PPP to connect to your ISP, you
  most probably need to adapt "status_reader.pl".  That is required,
  because "status_reader.pl" scans for PPP logfile mesages, which may
  look slightly different on pppd(1) for which "status_reader.pl" was
  written.

=== Feedback ====

Please tell me about required changes to let TkDialup work on your
system.  I am going to try to integrate thoose changes into the
upcoming releases then.

Thanks.
