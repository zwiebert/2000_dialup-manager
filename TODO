* BUGS

** bug-bw/23-Sep-00: setlocale de_DE breaks "graph 1h ..."
   (Tk::Error: bad screen distance "320.5" at /usr/lib/perl5/5.005/i386-linux/Tk.pm line 217.)

** bug-bw/23-Sep-00: rate-editor-window: remove-row does not clear cells correctly

** bug-old: using a brute-force NTP client leads to wrong accounting

** bug-bw/01-Jul-00: installation does not keep file timestamps

** bug-bw/22-Sep-00: On XFree86-4.0: A TearOff-menu does not show it
content immidiatly.  One have to send some XEvent (like moving the
window using the mouse).


* TODO

** todo--bw/12-Oct-00: Installing /etc/ppp/peers/TkDialup.  Ask user
to confirm (security problem)

** todo-bw/06-Oct-00: (interactive?) window showing costs for all rates, not only used ones

** todo-bw/13-Sep-00: Maybe we should use sockets to communicate
between dialer/status_reader and user interface. This would enable us
to control the pppd on a router.

** todo-bw/02-Sep-00: allow localization by users (locale in
$HOME). Use environment to pass locale file name.

** todo-bw/30-Aug-00: use one graph color per rate, but not one fore
each peer.



* DONE

** todo-bw/03-Oct-00: implement updating for cost-file content. avoid
saving content of default cost-file into user cost file.
*** done-bw/06-Oct-00:

** Catching exceptions for invalid/missing rates
*** done-bw/04-Oct-00

** Implementing holydays
*** done-bw/04-Oct-00: holydays are specified in country-XX. Absolute and
relative (to christian easter) holydays are possible.

** Distribute default dialup_manager.cfg for windows using w32ras
*** done-bw/21-Sep-00: pon/poff will be replaced using sed(1) at build time

** tkdialup: tac(1) not available on w32
*** done-bw/21-Sep-00: tac(1) no longer used

** w32fix-bw/06-Sep-00: LOG should not stay open for write, so
new_stat.pl can read from it.
*** done-bw/06-Sep-00

** bug-bw/06-Sep-00: Save config not possible.
*** bugfix-bw/06-Sep-00: Initial creating of a new config file was not
possible, because dm::write_config() wanted opening it for reading
first.

** tkdialup.pl: bug-bw/05-Sep-00 Balloon help on menus cannot be
switched off (problem in Tk itself?)
*** done-bw/05-Sep-00: I was using '-state' in atach() method.  This
stated was shadowing the switched '-state'.

** todo-bw/01-Jul-00: don't show all ISPs in graph. Show only active
ones or use a special graph flag (bad idea).
